# jmpstart

This is the GitHub repository for the [Open Cloud Jmpstart](https://tinyletter.com/bureado) and contains raw Markdowns, dotfiles, SVGs and other assets for the tinyletter. Make sure you [subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/bureado)!

## What is it

From Linux to containers and emerging open source technologies, this jmpstart provides critical commentary on the state of the open cloud and helps you and your team build a viewpoint.

## Why

For the last two years, I've been curating open cloud news on my free time across key media outlets, analysts, social media and beyond, sharing it via the [firehose RSS](https://goo.gl/esDpWq) and speaking about this market intelligence effort at events like the Open Source Leadership Summit. This [jmpstart](https://goo.gl/pQwcgr) is an effort to continue communicating this to a broader audience.

At its core, I attempt to describe the key trends in areas such as application and data platform, next-gen infrastructure, cultural transformation & open source in the enterprise and programming language evolution. While the firehose is updated almost daily, I try to maintain a monthly or quarterly basis for hindsight. My intel is notably lacking on areas like Big Data or IoT, which are important components to the open cloud, but where I'm running out of capacity for now.

## Feedback

The jmpstart is inspired by many reports, from ThoughtWorks' Radar to the CNCF Landscape as well as great analysis over at RedMonk or The New Stack. I've been doing open source for over 15 years and I'm a strong proponent of open market intelligence. I therefore strive to maintain the sources, process and insights as open as possible. Feedback is always welcome! Find me on Twitter, GitHub and elsewhere: [@bureado](https://twitter.com/bureado).
